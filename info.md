---

The MIT AI and Ethics reading group aims to facilitate interdisciplinary, institute-wide discussions about AI technology and the concerns they motivate. We want to provide a space for people in the MIT community to ask questions, gather feedback on ideas or research, learn about these topics, and find a community of other people interested in engaging. 

If you are interested, [please join our mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/ai-ethics).

UPDATE: In spring 2020, we will have bi-weekly meetings on Thursdays from 5-6pm!


## Next meeting

The next meeting will be **Thursday 2/13** 5-6pm. Stay posted for info about the topic and location!

## Looking ahead

Our planned meeting dates for this semester are 2/13, 2/27, 3/12, 4/2, 4/16, 4/30, and 5/14.

If you have articles or papers you would like to discuss or are interested in leading a future reading group meeting, please contact hsuresh [at] mit [dot] edu and lgilpin [at] mit [dot] edu.
